## Contributing to a GitHub/GitLab project

How to create a pull request that causes no pain to the maintainer.

### Setting up your local development environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone it on your local system
3. Add the upstream repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<upstream-repo>.git
   ```

4. Verify the new remote:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

### Working locally

In most cases, the master branch is the "production environment" of the upstream project. **Never** work on the master branch directly, instead create a new branch. Use short, descriptive names matching issue or ticket IDs, e.g.:

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/gh-45
```

1. Every time you start working on the code, it's important to be sure you have the latest from upstream:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream/master
    ```

2. Rebase your local branch onto the master branch:

    ```bash
    git rebase master
    ```

3. Resolve any conflicts and commit
4. Do your work, commit
5. Push to your own fork

    ```bash
    git push
    ```

### Sending the Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

2. Open the upstream repository in your browser and click **"New pull request"**.
3. Select your branch from the drop-down as the compare branch, and ensure the upstream repositoryâ€™s main branch is the base.
4. Review the changes shown in the diff pane to confirm they are correct.
5. Fill out the PR form:
   - Title: concise summary of your change.
   - Description: context, purpose, and any testing performed.
6. Submit the pull request.
7. Monitor for feedback:
   - Respond to review comments.
   - Push updates to your branch; the Pull Request will auto-update.
8. The repo owner will merge the Pull Request once reviews are complete and checks pass.
