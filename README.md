# Linux SysAdmin Cheat Sheets

This is a collection of cheat sheets that I've compiled for various systems, tools, and services throughout my career as a Linux SysAdmin. Saving them in a git repo allows me to 'take them with me' at any job I move to. I also don't need to concern myself with hosting while still being able to share them with others.

Although you're welcome to use them, I highly recommend you create your own. A cheat sheet is personal and should be highly customized to your situation and to the way your brain thinks.

Ideally, a cheat sheet contains those commands/shortcuts that you recently learned and want to have at hand because you haven't commited them to long-term memory yet. Things that you know well should not be in the cheat sheet. Too many commands that you don't know at all is also not ideal, as it makes it hard to find what you need in the list.

The idea is originally from [bertvv](https://github.com/bertvv/cheat-sheets).
